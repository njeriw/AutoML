# AutoML with Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT)

This project explores an automated machine learning (AutoML) technique to efficiently and automatically discover high-performing machine learning pipelines for a classification task. The pipeline automates model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

The chosen technique, Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), is an open-source library for performing AutoML in Python. It utilizes a Genetic Programming stochastic global search procedure to efficiently discover a top-performing model pipeline for a given dataset.


# Key Features
* **Automated Pipeline Search**: Automatically searches for the optimal combination of data transformers and machine learning models.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses advanced search algorithms (like Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, TPE) to efficiently find the best hyperparameters.
* **Reproducible Pipelines**: The project generates and exports the code for the best-found pipeline, making it easy to reproduce results and deploy the model.
